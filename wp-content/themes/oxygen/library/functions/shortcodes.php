/**
 * Shortcodes bundled for use with themes.  These shortcodes are not meant to be used with the post content 
 * editor.  Their purpose is to make it easier for users to filter hooks without having to know too much PHP code
 * and to provide access to specific functionality in other (non-post content) shortcode-aware areas.  Note that 
 * some shortcodes are specific to posts and comments and would be useless outside of the post and comment 
 * loops.  To use the shortcodes, a theme must register support for 'hybrid-core-shortcodes'.
